# mathFunc
General Description:
Create a C++ program that finds the cosine, sine and tangent of an angle entered by the user in degrees. Be sure you prompt the user for the angle including the required units. The program will need to convert the input angle to radians. Display the angle in both degrees and radians along with the calculated cosine, sine, and tangent.

All variables and constants used should be of type double.

Use the fact that PI = arcosine(-1) to define a named constant called PI.

Use the fact that there are PI / 180 radians per degree to do the conversion from degrees to radians.

Make sure you end your output with the endl or "\n" new line character.

Expected Results when the input angle is 25 degrees:
```
The cosine of 0.436332 radians, 25 degrees, is approximately 0.906308.
The sine of 0.436332 radians, 25 degrees, is approximately 0.422618.
The tangent of 0.436332 radians, 25 degrees, is approximately 0.466308.
